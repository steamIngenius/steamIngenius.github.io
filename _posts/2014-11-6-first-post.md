This is my first post on GitHub pages. This is also my first post using the Jekyll blog-aware static site generator.

### So far, so good
Sorry it's so boring! I didn't even need to use any special Markdown for this content...

Just to church it up a bit, I'll include a Javascript code snippet that does a thing.

	for ( var item in list ) {
		console.log(list[item]);
	}

### Pretty...
Markdown is nice to look at if nothing else. A lot of folks have **strong** feelings about Markdown and speak with *emphasis* when the topic is raised in conversation.
